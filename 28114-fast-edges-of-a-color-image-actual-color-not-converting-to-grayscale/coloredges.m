function [edge_magnitude, edge_orientation] = coloredges(im)
%COLOREDGES Edges of a color image by the max gradient method.
%   [MAGNITUDE, ORIENTATION] = COLOREDGES(IMAGE)
%   Extracts the edges of a color image without converting it to grayscale.
%
%   Changes in color are detected even when the grayscale color of two
%   pixels are the same. The edge strength is typically greater or equal to
%   the magnitude obtained by simply filtering a grayscale image.
%
%   Optionally, the edge orientation can also be returned.
%
%   Example
%   -------
%   The image generated by the example code shows two edge types:
%     White - edges found by both methods.
%     Red - edges found only by the color method.
%
%   This clearly shows that a significant amount of information is lost by
%   the standard method, but it is recovered with the gradient method.
%
%     figure, im = imread('peppers.png'); imshow(im)
%
%     %get color edges and normalize magnitude
%     C = coloredges(im);
%     C = C / max(C(:));
%
%     %get grayscale edges and normalize magnitude
%     G_image = single(rgb2gray(im)) / 255;
%     G = sqrt(imfilter(G_image, fspecial('sobel')').^2 + imfilter(G_image, fspecial('sobel')).^2);
%     G = G / max(G(:));
%
%     %show comparison
%     figure, imshow(uint8(255 * cat(3, C, G, G)))
%
%   Algorithm
%   ---------
%   The RGB color of each pixel is treated as a 3D vector, and the strength
%   of the edge is the magnitude of the maximum gradient. This also works
%   if the image is in any other (3-dimensional) color space. Direct
%   formulas for the jacobian eigenvalues were used, so this function is
%   vectorized and yields good results without sacrificing performance.
