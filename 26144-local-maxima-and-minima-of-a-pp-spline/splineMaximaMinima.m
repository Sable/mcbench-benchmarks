function [maxima, minima] = splineMaximaMinima(ppSpline)
%Get a list of all the local maxima and minima in a piecewise spline fit generated by spline in a
%command such as ppSpline = spline(x,Y); ppSpline must be of order 4 (ppSpline.order == 4)
%Example:
% ppSpline = spline(1:100,rand(100,1));
% %To plot the results use the following:
% figure;
% plot(1:0.1:100,ppval(ppSpline,1:0.1:100));
% [maxima, minima] = splineMaximaMinima(ppSpline);
% hold on
% plot(maxima,ppval(ppSpline,maxima),'r*');
% plot(minima,ppval(ppSpline,minima),'g*');

% %The above method is fast, because it uses a vectorised formula.
% %The matlab method (using the Spline toolbox) of achieving this functionality is, AFAIK,  to do the following (but this is very slow):
% %Differentiate the spline
% derivativeSpline = fnder(ppSpline);
% %Find the maxima and minima everywhere
% maximaMinima = mean(fnzeros(derivativeSpline));
% %Find the second differential of the spline
% secondDerivativeSpline = fnder(derivativeSpline);
% %Determine whether maximaMinima values are at maxima or minima positions
% minima = maximaMinima(find(ppval(secondDerivativeSpline,maximaMinima)>0));
% maxima = maximaMinima(find(ppval(secondDerivativeSpline,maximaMinima)<0));
