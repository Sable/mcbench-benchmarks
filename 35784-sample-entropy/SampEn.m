function saen = SampEn( dim, r, data, tau )
% SAMPEN Sample Entropy
%   calculates the sample entropy of a given time series data

%   SampEn is conceptually similar to approximate entropy (ApEn), but has
%   following differences:
%       1) SampEn does not count self-matching. The possible trouble of
%       having log(0) is avoided by taking logarithm at the latest step.
%       2) SampEn does not depend on the datasize as much as ApEn does. The
%       comparison is shown in the graph that is uploaded.

%   dim     : embedded dimension
%   r       : tolerance (typically 0.2 * std)
%   data    : time-series data
%   tau     : delay time for downsampling (user can omit this, in which case
%             the default value is 1)
