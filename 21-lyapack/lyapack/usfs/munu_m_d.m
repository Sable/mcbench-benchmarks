function [ML,MU] = munu_m_d
%
%  Deletes the global data that has been generated by 'munu_m_i'.
%
%  Calling sequence:
%
%    munu_m_d 
%    [ML,MU] = munu_m_d
% 
%  Output:
%
%    ML, MU      LU factors of M
%
%  ML and MU are returned just in case the LU factors of M are needed for some 
%  reason after the computation is done, but have been deleted to save memory.
