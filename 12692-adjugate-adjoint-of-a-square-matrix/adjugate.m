function B = adjugate(A)% This finds the adjugate (adjoint) of square matrix A,% and is valid even if A is singular or complex-valued.% With u, s, and v obtained from [u,s,v] = svd(A), it% makes use of the identity adj(A) = det(u*v')*v*adj(s)*u',% which holds even if A and s are singular.  The expression,% diag(prod(reshape(s0(ix),n-1,n),1)), accomplishes the% evaluation of adj(s), each of whose diagonal elements% is the product of all but one of the diagonal elements% of s.  This requires that A be n x n where n >= 2.% Roger Stafford - 10/18/06[m,n] = size(A);if (m ~= n) | (n < 2) error('Matrix A should be size n x n with n >= 2.')end[u,s,v] = svd(A);s0 = diag(s);ix = toeplitz(ones(n-1,1),[1 zeros(1,n-1)]) ...     + repmat((1:n-1)',1,n);B = det(u*v')*v*diag(prod(reshape(s0(ix),n-1,n),1))*u';% ---
