%
% Release 5.1
% Major features:
% - An improved algorithm used in fingerprint matching, highly recommended for high-performance applications
% - A generalized and optimized version of the algorithm for core point localization
% - Improved database
% - Demo code (protected P-files) available for performance evaluation
% 
% Release 5.0
% Major features:
% - The merging technique is greatly improved. This new algorithm was tested on FVC2004 training fingerprint images. Test results are available on request. Please email me in order to obtain them.
% - Parameters for image segmentation are estimated automatically
% - An improved algorithm is used when the rotated FingerCode is added to database. Now this procedure does not introduce any additional noise
% - A faster fingerprint image acquisition when a new fingerprint image is added to database
% - Implementation of 1D and 2D recursive Gabor filtering
% - Optimized pixel-wise orientation field estimation ( 80% faster than Release 4.0 )
% - List of fingerprint databases available on the web
% 
% Release 4.0
% Major features:
% - An improved algorithm for core point detection, based on a novel hybrid technique
% - A better fingerprint segmentation which makes use of morphological operations (binary erosion and dilation)
% - Exhaustive documentation of the implemented algorithms
% - Improved GUI
% - Better error management
% - Image enhancement
% - Orientation field estimation
