function [xc, yc] = getmidpointcircle(x0, y0, radius)
%% GETMIDPOINTCIRCLE return the x,y pixel coordinates of a circle
%
% [x y] = GETMIDPOINTCIRCLE(x0, y0, radius) returns the pixel coordinates
% of the circle centered at pixel position [x0 y0] and of the given integer
% radius. The mid-point circle algorithm is used for computation
% (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm).
%
% This function is aimed at image processing applications, where the
% integer pixel coordinates matter, and for which one pixel cannot be
% missed or duplicated. In that view, using rounded trigonometric
% coordinates generated using cosine calls are inadequate. The mid-point
% circle algorithm is the answer. 
%
% Accent is made on performance. We compute in advance the number of point
% that will be generated by the algorithm, to pre-allocate the coordinates
% arrays. I have tried to do this using a MATLAB class implementing the
% iterator pattern, to avoid computing the number of points in advance and
% still be able to iterate over circle points. However, it turned out that
% repeated function calls is extremely expansive, and the class version of
% this function is approximately 1000 times slower. With this function, you
% can get the pixel coordinates of a circle of radius 1000 in 0.16 ms, and
% this time will scale linearly with increasing radius (e.g. it takes 
% 0.16 s for a radius of 1 million).
%
% Also, this functions ensure that sorted coordinates are returned. The
% mid-point algorithm normally generates a point for the 8 circles octants
% in one iteration. If they are put in an array in that order, the [x y]
% points will jump from one octant to another. Here, we ensure that they
% are returned in order, starting from the top point, and going clockwise.
