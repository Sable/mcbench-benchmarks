% LAMBERT            Lambert-targeter for ballistic flights
%                    (Izzo, and Lancaster, Blanchard & Gooding)
%
% Usage: 
%    [V1, V2, extremal_distances, exitflag] = lambert(r1, r2, tf, m, GM_central)
%
% Dimensions:
%             r1, r2 ->  [1x3]
%             V1, V2 ->  [1x3]
% extremal_distances ->  [1x2]
%              tf, m ->  [1x1]
%         GM_central ->  [1x1]
%
% This function solves any Lambert problem *robustly*. It uses two separate
% solvers; the first one tried is a new and unpublished algorithm developed 
% by Dr. D. Izzo from the European Space Agency [1]. This version is extremely
% fast, but especially for larger [m] it still fails quite frequently. In such 
% cases, a MUCH more robust algorithm is started (the one by Lancaster & 
% Blancard [2], with modifcations, initial values and other improvements by 
% R.Gooding [3]), which is a lot slower partly because of its robustness.

% INPUT ARGUMENTS:

%  exitflag             [-]   Integer containing information on why the
%                             routine terminated. A value of +1 indicates
%                             success; a normal exit. A value of -1
%                             indicates that the given problem has no
%                             solution and cannot be solved. A value of -2
%                             indicates that both algorithms failed to find
%                             a solution. This should never occur since
%                             these problems are well-defined, and at the
%                             very least it can be determined that the
%                             problem has no solution. Nevertheless, it
%                             still occurs sometimes for accidental
%                             erroneous input, so it provides a basic
%                             mechanism to check any application using this
%                             algorithm. 
% 
% This routine can be compiled to increase its speed by a factor of about
% 50, which is certainly advisable when the complete application requires 
% a great number of Lambert problems to be solved. The entire routine is 
% written in embedded MATLAB, so it can be compiled with the emlmex() 
% function. To do this, make sure MATLAB's current directory is equal to 
% where this file is located. Then, copy-paste and execute the following 
% commands to the command window:
%
%    example_input = {...
%         [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ...% r1vec
%         [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ...% r2vec
%          0.0, ...           % tf
%          0.0, ...           % m
%          0.0};              % muC
%    emlmex -eg example_input lambert.m
%
% This is of course assuming your compiler is configured correctly. See the 
% docs on emlmex() on how to do that.

% This routine implements a new algorithm that solves Lambert's problem. The
% algorithm has two major characteristics that makes it favorable to other
% existing ones.
%
% 1) It describes the generic orbit solution of the boundary condition
% problem through the variable X=log(1+cos(alpha/2)). By doing so the
% graph of the time of flight become defined in the entire real axis and
% resembles a straight line. Convergence is granted within few iterations
% for all the possible geometries (except, of course, when the transfer
% angle is zero). When multiple revolutions are considered the variable is
% X=tan(cos(alpha/2)*pi/2).
%
% 2) Once the orbit has been determined in the plane, this routine
% evaluates the velocity vectors at the two points in a way that is not
% singular for the transfer angle approaching to pi (Lagrange coefficient
% based methods are numerically not well suited for this purpose).
%
% As a result Lambert's problem is solved (with multiple revolutions
% being accounted for) with the same computational effort for all
% possible geometries. The case of near 180 transfers is also solved
% efficiently.
%
%  We note here that even when the transfer angle is exactly equal to pi
% the algorithm does solve the problem in the plane (it finds X), but it
% is not able to evaluate the plane in which the orbit lies. A solution
% to this would be to provide the direction of the plane containing the
% transfer orbit from outside. This has not been implemented in this
% routine since such a direction would depend on which application the
% transfer is going to be used in.

% By default, the short-way solution is computed. The long way solution
% may be requested by giving a negative value to the corresponding
% time-of-flight [tf].
%
% For problems with |m| > 0, there are generally two solutions. By
% default, the right branch solution will be returned. The left branch
% may be requested by giving a negative value to the corresponding
% number of complete revolutions [m].
