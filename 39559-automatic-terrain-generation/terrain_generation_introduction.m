%% Demonstration of Algorithmic Terrain Generation
%
% This script demonstrates how approximately realistic-looking terrain can
% be generated with some very simple algorithms. These algorithms are
% interesting in their simplicity and their strictly-geometrical
% interpretation. That is, no effort is made to model techtonic plates, 
% erosion, rivers, etc., and yet these features appear to exist
% nonetheless in the generated terrain. These methods are part of a class
% known as fractional Brownian motion, fractal generation methods, and
% several other names and originated with Benoît Mandelbrot.
%
% For instance, the following image was created with a very brief
% algorithm, and the same type of algorithm that generated the terrain
% geometry was used to control color variation across the terrain for rock,
% dirt, vegetation, etc.

%% Basic Terrain Generation
% First, we'll show how a couple of these methods might be used. We'll then
% proceed to a discussion of approximately how they work. Finally, we'll
% wrap up with a few options for controlling the result.

% Create a landscape.

%% Terrain Points
% Plot the triangles represented by all the points. We'll add lighting too
% to make the detail easier to see.

trisurf(delaunay(x, y), x, y, h);
colormap jet;                    % Default color map.
set(gca, 'Position', [0 0 1 1]); % Fill the figure window.
axis equal vis3d;                % Set aspect ratio.
shading interp;                  % Interpolate color across faces.
camlight left;                   % Add a light over to the left somewhere.
lighting gouraud;                % Use decent lighting.

%% Meshed Terrain
% Plot as a mesh. Note that this is zoomed in on the median off all of the
% generated points in order to capture the detailed middle instead of the
% relatively uneventful edges.
surf(xm, ym, hm);
set(gca, 'Position', [0 0 1 1]); % Fill the figure window.
axis equal vis3d;                % Set aspect ratio.
shading interp;                  % Interpolate color across faces.
camlight left;                   % Add a light over to the left somewhere.
lighting gouraud;                % Use decent lighting.

%% Realistic-Looking Terrain
% We can add some natural-looking colors to this. Note that this process
% uses the same type of underlying algorithm to generate the variation in
% different colors. E.g., steep areas are likely to be colored as rock, but
% the variation in the degree to which they take on rock colors and the
% variation in the rock color itself across the map are both meshes
% generated by a similar means. That is, areas with a 1 or higher will
% definitely be colored as rock. Areas with 0 or lower definitely will not.
% Everything in between is a gradient of rockiness.
%
% Note that this involves creating multiple meshes for grass, for trees,
% for rock, for dirt, and for water, so this function consists of numerous
% calls to generation methods and therefore takes substantially longer than
% to generate the terrain itself.

%% Other Uses
% In addition to generating terrain, these methods can be used to generate
% other useful topologies. For instance, suppose one were simulating a
% city's ability to respond to an emergency. These tools could be used to
% generate a population density map for the city, such that what might be a
% "mountain" when viewed as terrain is instead a high population area. This
% population map could be used to generate random emergencies (such that
% high population areas have more emergencies), stressing the simulated
% capabilities of the emergency response teams. Other examples might 
% include generation of the corrosion of a metallic surface or of 2D
% probability density distributions. Consider the following, in which the
% terrain is automatically generated and a population density map is
% similarly generated.

% Make the terrain.
[~, ~, ~, hm, xm, ym] = generate_terrain(7, 513, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05);

% Create our population density map.

pm = generate_brownian_mesh(9, zeros(2, 2));

% We can't have negative population density or people living underwater.

% Notice that for terrain, we use |generate_terrain|, but for the 
% population data, we use |generate_brownian_mesh|, which is faster, but
% slightly less terrain-like. Note also that care was taken to ensure the
% population map size was the same size as the terrain map. We requested a
% 513-by-513 mesh for the terrain, and the |generate_brownian_mesh|
% produces a mesh of size $2^n+1$ by $2^n+1$, where $n$ is the first
% argument. This is due to the way the mesh doubles from its initial
% condition every iteration.

%%
% We'll use the population map to generate random emergencies, which are
% more likely in high-population areas. These methods can be used to
% simulate realistic conditions for operations research or optimization
% problems.

%% Additional Functions
% Several algorithms are included:
% 
% * |generate_brownian_mesh|  - Fastest, varies more along grid lines
% * |generate_brownian_tri|   - Slower, but gridless
% * |generate_terrain|        - Slowest, but best for terrain in particular
%
% Several terrain-oriented tools are also included, mostly for fun:
% 
% * |generate_scene|          - Creates and colors terrain
% * |generate_terrain_colors| - Generate colors for a terrain map
% * |render_random_scenes|    - Produces and saves several terrain scenes
% * |sun_tones|               - Generates appropriate sky color for time
%
% A general utility, |FigureRotator|, is included in the "extras" zip file
% as well. This allows a user to rotate around a target point, move in and 
% out, and zoom in and out. It's available separately on FileExchange. The
% FigureRotator can be extracted with |unzip terrain_generation_extras.zip|
% in this directory. It includes an example file and documentation 
% accessible via |help FigureRotator|.

%% How It Works

% random points somewhere near (0, 0). When we plot it, we'll add points
% around the edges to make a square.

%% Final Comments
% We looked at a few applications of these procedural generation methods to
% create realistic terrain, population data with random events, and 
% corrosion, and we further discussed what's behind these methods. For more
% information, see "Fractal landscape", "Brownian surface", or "Procedural
% generation" on Wikipedia or browse the wealth of resources produced by
% Benoît Mandelbrot on fractals and roughness. Going beyond the three
% included algorithms, it's easy to create a new or customized algorithm
% for a given purpose. Lateral thinking in this field is highly encouraged!
%
% Here are three final scenes, showing a few types of behaviour that can 
% result from these algorithms.
