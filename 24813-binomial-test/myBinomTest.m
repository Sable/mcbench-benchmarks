function pout=myBinomTest(s,n,p,Sided)
%function pout=myBinomTest(s,n,p,Sided)
%
% Performs a binomial test of the number of successes given a total number 
% of outcomes and a probability of success. Can be one or two-sided.
%
% Inputs:
%       s-      (Scalar or Array) The observed numebr of successful outcomes
%       n-      (Scalar or Array) The total number of outcomes (successful or not)
%       p-      (Scalar or Array) The proposed probability of a successful outcome
%       Sided-  (String) can be 'Two','Greater' or 'Lesser'. A value of
%               'Two' will perform a two-sided test, that the actual number
%               of success is different from the expected number of
%               successes in any direction. 'Greater' or 'Lesser' will
%               perform a 1-sided test to examine if the observed number of 
%               successes are either significantly greter than or less than
%               (respectively) the expected number of successes.
%
% Outputs:
%       pout-   The probability of observing the resulting value of s or a
%               value more extreme (the precise meaning of which depends on
%               the value of Sided) given n total outcomes with a 
%               probability of success of p.               
%
%       s, n and p can be scalars or arrays of the same size. The
%       dimensions and size of pout will match that of these inputs.
%
% For example, the signtest is a special case of this where the value of p
% is equal to 0.5 (and a 'success' is dfeined by whether or not a given
% sample is of a particular sign.), but the binomial test and this code is 
% more general allowing the value of p to be any value between 0 and 1.
