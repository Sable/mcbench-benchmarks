%GenerateNACASeries6Airfoil generates the airfoil vertexes' coordinate of
%the given NACA Series 6 Airfoil. The math equation used to generates the
%airfoil coordinates is based on Theory of Wing Section Chapter 6 by Abbott
%and Doenhoff.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%Syntax:
%[xu,yu,xl,yl,xc,yc]=GenerateNACASeries6Airfoil(afid,dotcount,xmod)
%Input argument:
%- afid (1 x 1 str) specifies NACA Series 6 Airfoil identifier. (Note that
%  there exist several format of identifier for NACA Series 6 Airfoil. This
%  code only accept the basic format of NACA Series 6 identifer (6X-XXX or
%  6XAXXX).
%- dotcount (1 x 1 int) specifies the number of vertexes to be generated on
%  the airfoil's camber/mean line.
%- xmod (str) specifies the mode of airfoil vertex distribution. Enter
%  'Uniform' to create uniform vertex distribution or 'Cosine' to create
%  vertex distribution based on cosine function (More vertex on the leading
%  edge region).
%Output argument:
%- xu (i x 1 num) specifies the x axis location of airfoil's upper surface
%  vertexes in fraction of chord. The airfoil's upper surface vertex are
%  arranged from leading edge (the first element of xu) to the trailing
%  edge (the last element of xu).
%- yu (i x 1 num) specifies the y axis location of airfoil's upper surface
%  vertexes in fraction of chord. The airfoil's upper surface vertex are
%  arranged from leading edge (the first element of yu) to the trailing
%  edge (the last element of yu).
%- xl (i x 1 num) specifies the x axis location of airfoil's lower surface
%  vertexes in fraction of chord. The airfoil's lower surface vertex are
%  arranged from leading edge (the first element of xl) to the trailing
%  edge (the last element of xl).
%- yl (i x 1 num) specifies the y axis location of airfoil's lower surface
%  vertexes in fraction of chord. The airfoil's lower surface vertex are
%  arranged from leading edge (the first element of yl) to the trailing
%  edge (the last element of yl).
%- xc (i x 1 num) specifies the x axis location of airfoil's camber line
%  vertexes in fraction of chord. The airfoil's camber line vertex are
%  arranged from leading edge (the first element of xc) to the trailing
%  edge (the last element of xc).
%- yc (i x 1 num) specifies the y axis location of airfoil's camber line
%  vertexes in fraction of chord. The airfoil's camber line vertex are
%  arranged from leading edge (the first element of yc) to the trailing
%  edge (the last element of yc).
