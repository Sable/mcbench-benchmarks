% mdp_LP    Resolution of discounted MDP with linear programming
% Arguments --------------------------------------------------------------
% Let S = number of states, A = number of actions
%   P(SxSxA) = transition matrix 
%              P could be an array with 3 dimensions or 
%              a cell array (1xA), each cell containing a matrix (SxS) possibly sparse
%   R(SxSxA) or (SxA) = reward matrix
%              R could be an array with 3 dimensions (SxSxA) or 
%              a cell array (1xA), each cell containing a sparse matrix (SxS) or
%              a 2D array(SxA) possibly sparse  
%   discount = discount rate, in ]0; 1[
% Evaluation -------------------------------------------------------------
%   V(S)   = optimal values
%   policy(S) = optimal policy
%   cpu_time = used CPU time
