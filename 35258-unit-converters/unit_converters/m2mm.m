function [mm] = m2mm(m)
% Convert length from meters to millimeters.  Trivial, yes, but using this
% function may help make your code more clear.  It'll save you a year from
% now when you revisit the code you're writing and you say, "why did I
% multiply this number by a thousand?"
mm = m*1000;
