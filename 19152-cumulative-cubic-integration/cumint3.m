function z = cumint3(x,y)%%   z = cumint3(x,y)%% This returns a vector z the same size as x and y% which is the cumulative integral of y with respect% to x, with the lower integration limit set to x(1) and% the upper limit ranging from x(1) to x(n). The% successive intervals in x need not be of equal lengths, % though none should be of zero length. A third order% approximation is made so that for up to cubic polynomials% the values will be exact except for rounding. % x and y must be column vectors of the same length% and have at least four elements. Note that with only % z = b.*g below, this would be computing matlab's% 'cumtrapz' trapezoidal integration, the rest of the% expression in z serving to carry out the additional% third order approximation.
